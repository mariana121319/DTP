## Dtp.py

### Overview

In this section, we will attach the Dtp.py file, which plays a crucial role in our workflow and implements essential functionalities with a defensive coding approach.

### Defensive Coding Practices

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs to the functions to prevent errors and exceptions.
2. **Error Handling**: Implement try-except blocks to gracefully handle unexpected situations.
3. **Code Readability**: Ensure that code is easy to read and well-commented.

### Conclusion

The combination of these practices not only ensures reliability but also enhances the maintainability of the code.
